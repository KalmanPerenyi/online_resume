          <li>Diageo launched one of its most complex technical projects to date: moving all of its servers to the cloud, including all SAP servers. IPS (Intercompany Pricing System) was heavily impacted, as it spans across three SAP systems (ECC, Fiori/Gateway and PO/BPM). As the application owner I was involved in every phase of this project.</li>
